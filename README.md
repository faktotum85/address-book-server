# What is this?
This is the backend for a playground project I set up to experiment with a few techniques. 
The frontend is here: https://github.com/faktotum85/address-book
You can see a demo of the full application here: https://sw-address-book.herokuapp.com

# Running the application locally
- Pull the repo and run npm install
- Make a copy of .env.dist and rename it to .env
    - change the variables in the .env file
    - You can use a mlab.com to quickly set up a mongodb database
- Run npm start in the root directory to spin up the application

# Todos
- Authenticate routes / filter results
- Add route for logging out
- Add tests
